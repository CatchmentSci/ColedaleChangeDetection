# ColedaleChangeDetection
This repository contains the scripts required to reproduce the morphological analysis undertaken in the research article: Mayes et al (2020) 'Effect of an extreme flood event on solute transport and resilience of a mine water treatment system in a mineralised catchment' published in Science of the Total Environment. Specifically: 

'mainLandslideDiff.m' script calculates the erosion volume (mn<sup>3</sup>) of a major hillslope failure along the Coledale Beck, Cumbria (UK) as a result of Storm Desmond (December 2015). This script also produces a Figure used to visualise hillslope erosion as an immediate response of Storm Desmond (A), and (B) in the period spanning March to December 2016. This Figure was used as Figure 2 in the aforementioned research article.

'smallerFailures.m' script is used to illustrate the continuing erosion along the Coledale Beck in the period spanning March to December 2016. Maps of erosion depth are provided at two locations (A, B). The Figure produced is presented as Figure S4 (Supplementary Information) in the aforementioned research article.
